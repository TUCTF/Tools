[xortool](https://github.com/hellman/xortool) - Tried to find the key for xor encrypted data

## Exploitation
[PEDA](https://github.com/longld/peda) - Irreplaceable addition to GDB. Adds a lot of useful features for finding and exploiting bugs in binaries.

[ROPGadget](https://github.com/JonathanSalwan/ROPgadget) - Finds gadgets in programs. For use with ROP exploits.

[pwntools](https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools) - Very useful when coding remote exploits for CTFs. Has a feature rich library that aims at making exploit developement for CTFs easier. Definitely check this one out.

## Forensics
[Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html) - The standard pcap analysis tool. Displays network traffic.

[pcapfix](https://github.com/Rup0rt/pcapfix) - Fixes corrupt pcap files.

[HexEdit](http://www.hexedit.com/download.htm) - Windows - Another Hex Editor.

[binwalk](http://binwalk.org/) - Linux/OSX - Firmware analysis tool.

## Reverse Engineering
[Java Decompiler](http://jd.benow.ca/) - Useful when needing to decompile Java class files. 

[IDA](https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/support/download.shtml) - The standard decompiler.

[Radare2](https://github.com/radare/radare2) - Seems like a better GDB. There appears to be a slight learning curve but this looks promising. 

[VB Decompiler](https://www.vb-decompiler.org/download.htm) - This program will take a VB program and give you a decent amount of information about it. Helpful for seeing the code inside of forms.

## Steganography
[Stegsolve](https://www.wechall.net/de/forum/show/thread/527/Stegsolve_1.3/) - Displays various aspects of pictures.

[Steganabara](http://www.caesum.com/handbook/steganabara-1.1.1.tar.gz) - Provides additional tools for analyzing pictures.

[binwalk](http://binwalk.org/) - Linux/OSX - See binwalk in Forensics. Also capable of retrieving embedded photos.

## Web
[Burp Suite](http://portswigger.net/burp/download.html) - Web proxy. Very helpful for web challenges.

[sqlmap](http://sqlmap.org/) - This helps automate easy SQL injection challenges. Most CTFs try to prevent the brute force approach but this should be useful for the easier challenges.

[Postman](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman/fhbjgbiflinjbdggehcddcbncdddomop?hl=en) - Chrome Extension - Create and send POST requests from within Chrome.
